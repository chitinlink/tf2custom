# Maps

Maps in this folder show up first in the autocomplete for `map ...` in the console.

This is also a useful place to put maps you only want to try once, so as to not lose them in your regular /maps/ folder.

With that said, here's the maps I usually keep here:

| Name             | Source             | Description
| :-:              | :-:                | :-
| `tr_juggle`      | [TF2Maps][rockets] | A field of bots jumping, with some options. Good for practicing airshots.
| `tr_walkway_rc2` | [TF2Maps][walkway] | A heavily customizable map with bots walking down a walkway.
