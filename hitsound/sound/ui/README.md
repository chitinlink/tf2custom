By adding a file named `hitsound.wav` to `/sound/ui/` you can change the default hitsound in the game. You may also add `killsound.wav` to change the default killsound.

Moreover, by adding `hitsound_electro.wav` you can change what the "Electro" hitsound sounds like, as well as a `killsound_electro.wav` if you want to change its killsound.
This appears to work with all the other hitsound names in TF2's advanced settings.

I keep other hitsound files I like in `hitsounds.zip`.
