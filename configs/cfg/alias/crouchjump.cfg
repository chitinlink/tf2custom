// Crouchjump
// like jumping but you crouch immediately after
// crouchjumping grants you +1hu of total vertical movement and also reduces your hitbox by
// 27hu from the bottom, allowing you to reach slightly highter surfaces and evade enemy fire.
// you can do this manually and it will have the exact same effect, ie, you dont need this alias.
